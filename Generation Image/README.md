# Image Generation Application
This application utilizes the OpenAI API to generate images based on user prompts. By providing a text prompt, the application interacts with OpenAI's powerful models to create visually compelling images.

# Features
Text Prompt Input: Users can input their desired prompt via the console.
Image Generation: Upon receiving the prompt, the application sends a request to the OpenAI API, which generates multiple images based on the provided text.
High-Quality Results: The application strives to deliver high-quality images by configuring parameters such as model selection, image size, and generation temperature.
Console Output: Once the images are generated, the application outputs the URLs of the generated images in the console, allowing users to access and view them easily.
# Getting Started
